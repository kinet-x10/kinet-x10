At Kinet-X I built things like a solar powered car and a heart with blinking LEDs. I could not finish either project but it was fun trying to make the project. Buiding the heart was fun to soder the
LEDs onto the plastic heart. And also building the car was very fun too. My teams car didn't work and it was just some plastic with two wheels and it did not move but it was 
still fun to make. We would have finished but we are making a  rocket safety system and are going to launch rockets in battry park.
