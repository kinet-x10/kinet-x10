I made complex circuits with wires resistors LEDs and a lot of intresting things. I also used buttons and switches and batteries to make an LED turn on. 
I tried to design a circuit to make  a logic gate with only one type of different gate.While modt people tries to make a hard XOR gate me and my partner couldn't 
even make a simple AND gate. When everyone else was making circits with a breadboard to ligght up 1 LED I msde a simple circuit that I attached to my one LED circuit to make three LEDs light
up.
