At Kinet-X I learned how to code many things that I did not know how  to code before. I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript.I made cool things like this webpage and coded things like
buttons that did different things. I also coded things like squares that got bigger when you hovered over it and links like the ones on the first page. I also coded a lot more
at Kinet-X like how to use background colors and how to use margins,and padding and many other things like the button below.
