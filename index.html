 What I did at Kinet-X
 
 </h1>
 <p>
 At Kinet-X I learned how to build and test things like solar powered cars and safety systems. I also learned how to code things like this webpage.
 I learned how to do many new things throuout the entire camp. I learned how to soder and make circuits. I used LEDs and resistors and logic gates. I learned how to code with CSS, HTML, and Java script too!
I made complex circuits in the first week and now am building a afety system for a rocket that has a password of  four switches to be able to blast off,
a green LED that turns on when the rocket is armed, a red LED when the rocket is off and a button that has to be held for 5 seconds for the rocket to blast off.
